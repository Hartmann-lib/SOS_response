## Global fit of logarithmic diffusion coefficient distributions 

This folder contains scripts and data to generate the logarithmic *D\** fits, using the model as described in the *Methods* section in the manuscript. The `globalMLE_4Diff` scripts perform fits to each dataset. The `modeling` folder contains scripts to perform coarse analysis of the counting data.
